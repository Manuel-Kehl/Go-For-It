    <p>
Go For It! is a simple and stylish productivity app, featuring a to-do list, merged with a timer that keeps your focus on the current task.
    </p>
    <p>
To-do lists are stored in the Todo.txt format. This simplifies synchronization with mobile devices and makes it possible to edit tasks using other front-ends.

    </release>
    <release version="1.9.0" date="2020-12-09">
      <description>
        <p>Improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is now possible to manually select todo.txt files for the task lists instead of selecting the folder to store those in. It is now also no longer necessary to have a separate todo.txt file for archiving completed tasks.</li>
          <li>For each list, it is now possible to select a CSV file to log your activity to.</li>
          <li>When logging activity to a new CSV file a header describing the column contents is added.</li>
          <li>Go For It! can now play a sound when it is time to take a break or when it is time to start working again.</li>
          <li>Go For It! now supports plugins. The plugins that are currently available are 2 plugins to show the remaining time: one for panels supporting Ayatana appindicators and another for docks/launchers supporting the LauncherEntry API.</li>
          <li>Most tooltips now include the shortcut alternative to clicking the widget.</li>
          <li>The option to select an application stylesheet has been removed. The automatically selected stylesheet should work for all reasonable Gtk+ 3.0 themes.</li>
          <li>The layout of the settings dialogs has been improved.</li>
          <li>Baselines are now taken into account when aligning the tasks.</li>
          <li>Moving tasks around using drag-and-drop now looks better. The point at which the task would be inserted is now shown by reserving space for that task instead of just showing a stripe between the 2 rows where it would get inserted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Popovers now use the same margins as GNOME apps if not targetting elementary OS.</li>
          <li>Some popover styling issues that occurred when using one of the io.elementary.stylesheet.* Gtk themes have been fixed.</li>
          <li>CSV output is no longer separated by both a comma and space, but just by commas.</li>
          <li>The menu entries for sorting tasks or clearing the list of completed tasks is now only shown if a task list is shown.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>

(Where X and Y are the number of hours and minutes respectively. For a five minute task one would need to add `duration:5m`.) Go For It! will notify you when you exceed this duration. (Do not forget to enable timer logging so Go For It! will know how much time you have spent working on a task after closing the application!)</li>
          <li>Not every break (or time between breaks) has to be of the same length: You can now use Go For It! as a pomodoro timer or use a custom timer schedule.</li>

          <li>Added "--list" and  "--load &lt;id&gt;" arguments to show the configured lists and load a specified list respectively.</li>
